[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/Gamote/lottie-react/blob/master/LICENSE) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@lottie-web/react.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lottie-web/react) ![npm downloads/week](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/@lottie-web/react)

This project is meant to give developers full control over **[Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/)** instance with minimal implementation by wrapping the **[lottie-web](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web)** to be used in **React** applications.

## Installation

Install **react**, **react-dom** and **prop-types** if you don’t have them already:

_**Note:** This library is using React hooks so the minimum version required for both react and react-dom is 16.8.0._

```
npm i -s react@^16.8.0 react-dom@^16.8.0 prop-types@^15.5.7
```

Install **@lottie-web/react** using npm:
```
npm i -s @lottie-web/react
```
